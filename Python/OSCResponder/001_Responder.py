"""OSC Test Script
Written by Aaron Chamberlain Dec. 2013
The purpose of this script is to make a very simple communication structure to the popular
application touchOSC. This is achieved through the pyOSC library. However, since the pyOSC
documentation is scarce and only one large example is included, I am going to strip down
the basic structures of that file to implement a very simple bi-directional communication.
